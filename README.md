# Tank-Game
This game was created due to my passion for video games, and my desire to learn web development. This project is constantly teaching me core Javascript, and how elements on the DOM can interact with each other.

## Stack
This game is build in core Javascript, HTML, and CSS. jQuery is also used for DOM manipulation.
